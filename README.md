# dotfiles: README

This is just a collection of dotfiles in my home directory I use personally.
They contain snippets of things I've found useful collected from other's
dotfiles, my own tinkering, and various places around the Internet.

## How to use this repo

First you should fork this so you have your own copy.

After you fork it do the following...

  cd ~
  git clone --recursive git@example.com:username/dotfiles.git
  cd dotfiles
  ./linkem
  cd ~
  source .bashrc
  source .profile

That should be it. Note the "--recursive" as there are submodules.
